# Premium check
>for CMC6 Point of sale printers

This was a quick build in order to guide people in understand whether or not a unit is of "Premium Quality".

## Getting started

All this really needs is a web browser. It uses JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. Internet required.

```No shell navigation necessary
```
Just drag the HTML file to the browser. Chrome preferred.

### Initial Configuration

None.

## Developing

This could be taken further, and may be built into a more complex system but currently it served it's purpose.

## Features

* It will pull up a form asking 3 questions.
* It will prompt you with the correct message when selections are chosen.
* It Will also highlight green if the answer passes the requirement, and red when it doesn't.
* If it passes all requirements then it will display a message.
* If any of those requirements fail after that, it will change the message.

## Contributing

Any type of contribution would be great. I would love to see better ways of doing things. I know my code could use it :D
